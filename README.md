StabLinRB
=========

Computes the linear stability in the Rayleigh-Bénard problem.

The curve of critical Rayleigh number as function of wavenumber is computed
and plotted and the minimum value of the Rayleigh number is obtained along
with the corresponding value of the wavenumber. The first unstable
mode can also be plotted, both as profiles of the z dependence and as
temperature-velocity maps.

The present code uses the Chebyshev differentiation matrices. It was
developed as part of a project which led to several publications in
which the details of the method can be found:
